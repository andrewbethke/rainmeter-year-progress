# Year Progress Bar for Rainmeter

![the skin in action](yearprogressscreenshot.jpg)

This is a simple [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) skin that provides two choices for tracking how much of the year has passed. It includes both a progress bar and a text printout. They are separate skins, so you can elect to use either one on its own or both in conjunction with each other, as seen in the image above.

Inspired by discussion of the year progress twitter account on the [Cortex Podcast, episode 118.](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/118) I can't remember whether or not it was the same episode, but I also remember mention of a Mac menu bar widget (or whatever Apple calls it) that puts a similar progress bar there

I wanted that, but with my Rainmeter stuff, but as far as I could tell nobody had made one. So I did. More complicated Rainmeter stuff seems like absolute witchcraft to me still, especially since something this simple took me multiple hours, but eventually I did it.
